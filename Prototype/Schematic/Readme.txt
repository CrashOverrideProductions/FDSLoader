Prototype Schematic for FDS SD Loader
Eagle Schematic File and PDF included


17/03/19:
  Schematic is almost a copy of the QDC ATMega-164 schematic which appears to be based upon the FMD-POWER-05 PCB

  FDSLoadr does not use any inverters/gates, at this point im assuming that the program preformed any logic gate functions 
  and did not require the use of them, in this prototype the plan is to use logic gates to reduce processor load
